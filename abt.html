<p>Hello! I'm Harinee, a passionate and driven second-year B.Tech student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I thrive at the intersection of technology and creativity, with a strong foundation in Python, data analysis, machine learning, and full-stack web development.<br>

    My journey so far includes hands-on experience with real-world datasets, building intelligent systems like recommendation engines and prediction models, and designing interactive web applications.<br> I enjoy turning ideas into meaningful, user-friendly solutions—whether it's a student progress tracker, a gamified learning platform, or a dynamic planner app.<br>
    
    I’m constantly learning, exploring new technologies, and pushing my limits through projects, seminars, and hackathons. My goal is to contribute to innovative product-based companies and grow as a well-rounded AI and Data Science professional.<br>
    
    Let’s build something impactful together!</p>
